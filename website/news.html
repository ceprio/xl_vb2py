                                            <p>v0.2.1 is a bug fix and minor enhancement version. Quite a large number of Visual Basic functions and keywords were not supported in v0.2 and this is addressed to some extent by this release. The following additional functions were added for this release: Array, ChDir, Choose, Environ, EOF, Erase, FileCopy, FileLen, Filter, FreeFile, IIf, Input, InStrRev, IsArray, Join, Kill, Let, Lof, LSet, LTrim, RTrim, Trim, MkDir, Name, Randomize, Replace, Reset, RGB, RmDir, Rnd, Round, RSet, GetAllSettings, GetSetting, SaveSetting, DeleteSetting, Spc, Split, StrReverse, Switch, Timer. The coverage is still not 100% but if you whave an urgent need for a function it can easily be bumped up the queue! Version 0.2.1 Download </p>

                                            <p>Converting large VB applications can be daunting because there is so much code to test to confirm that the VB and Python version really do behave in the same way. To aid in this process there is now an experimental code tester available on the CVS version. This tester allows you to copy VB code into one pane and have the code converted and tested automatically. This works by using the Windows Scripting host so this only works on Windows and currently only supports VB Script (so some valid VB code will not work). Click here to see some screenshots. </p>

                                            <p>You can now try out vb2Py online without all the hassle of installing libraries etc. Follow this link to the demo page and type or paste in your VB code and the watch as it is converted to Python before your very eyes! The conversion is based on the v0.2 code base and currently only supports Code and Class module conversion for a single file. However, this is a good way to try things out or to convert small sections of VB code. Depending on the type of code you may need to down load the vb2py package to actually run the code as many of the VB intrinsic functions are only defined in the package. </p>

                                            <p>Version 0.2 is now available. The key development in v0.2 is the inclusion of the full VB code parser and converter. Whereas v0.1 was just a form layout converter, v0.2 parses all the VB code and translates it to the equivalent Python code. All major code constructs from VB are covered (Sub, Fn, If, While, For, Select, With, Classes, Properties, Types, etc) and most instrinsic functions and constants are implemented as Python equivalents. The other major addition to v0.2 is the inclusion of a GUI to enable the progress of the conversion to be monitored and tweaked using the options system. The GUI is a PythonCard application running on top of the main vb2py library. The GUI is not required to convert VB code, a fully functioning command line alternative is available. Linux is now supported (this was badly broken in v0.1!) The main download is available here. The GUI download is here. </p>

Things are still at an early stage, but it is actually useable to browse projects and see the converted code. Using the Options dialog you can see the impact of changing global settings.
